# Communist simulator
* The objective of the game is to drop a nuclear bomb on a target avoiding some clouds that would prevent our progress
* based on the code of simple Slalom
* When the target is hit the bomb will explode and the soviet national anthem will be played in celebration of our victory over the capitalist pigs.

After the game is won, a radio message is sent to other microbits telling them that our communist system is great.
