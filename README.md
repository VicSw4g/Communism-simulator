# Communist simulator
* The objective of the game is to drop a nuclear bomb on a target avoiding some clouds that would prevent our progress.
* It is based on the code of simple Slalom.
* When the score is greater than 10, the bomb will explode and the soviet national anthem will be played in celebration of our victory over the capitalist pigs.
If you fail in this task the capitalists will win. We must not let this happen comrades!

After the game is won, a radio message is sent to other microbits telling them of our great communist system.

The microbit utilizes the accelerometer during gameplay.
