This program can further be developed to incorporate more microbits and adding more rounds to the game.
Each seperate microbit can be described as having different targets.
The game can then be played by multiple people simultaneously and the success of the group is determined.
The overall score is displayed for each round of games and is dependent on the success or failure of players to eliminate their targets.
This information is sent between the microbits using the onboard radio.
Then you can virtually destroy nations in this Microbit mini-game.
